# PREDICT-WINE-QUALITY

# SOFTWARE
I did this project using ```python 3```.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
I used the wine data set from the UCL Machine Learning Repository. I tried several linear and nonlinear models to see which one produces better accuracy. I did this procedure using non standardized and standardized data. I tuned the best performing model and I tried ensemble methods. I got the best results (i.e. lowest mean squared error) using ExtraTrees Regressor with n_estimators = 400. 
I finally tested my model on the validation set and got a MSE of 0.27.
